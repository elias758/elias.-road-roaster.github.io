	<h2>A Short History</h2>
    
    <p>The history of coffee is a <a href="http://ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=68">long one</a>, but the history of good coffee and Mount Pleasant is easier to tell. While it's rumoured that  John Schofield (first fleet settler and founder of Mount Pleasant) was a coffee drinker, the first real cafe in Mount Pleasant opened shortly after the community was incorporated in 1878 when Anne Boudreau opened "Annie's Place". Annie's Place was <em>&quot;the place to be&quot;</em> in Mount Pleasant until Phil Boudreau, (Annie's great-grand-nephew) closed the historic cafe's doors for the last time in 1986.</p>
    
	<p>After Annie's Place closed, the Schofield Building changed hands many times, becoming a hardware store, a travel agency, and a computer store until Scott Bennett bought the historic building in 2008. Following a thorough restoration, Scott opened Banks Road Roasters in the same spot Annie's Place once occupied. "I'm proud to be part of Mount Pleasant's history, and I like to think Annie would approve."</p>
